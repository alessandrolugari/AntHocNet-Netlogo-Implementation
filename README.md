# AntHocNet-Netlogo-Implementation
Implementation of the algorithm AnthHocNet in Netlogo. This is part of the exam Distributed Artificial Ingelligence held at UNIMORE.

# The Algorithm
AntHocNet is a routing algorithm used in MANETs. Due to the strict requirements that those networks have, using an adaptive algorithm that changes based on the current conditions can be effective.
The algorithm is both reactive and proactive.
