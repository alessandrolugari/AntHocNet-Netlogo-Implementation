# AntHocNet-Netlogo-Implementation
Implementation of the algorithm AnthHocNet in Netlogo. This is part of the exam Distributed Artificial Ingelligence held at UNIMORE.



# The Algorithm
AntHocNet is an algorithm used for routing in MANETs. These are special networks in which the mobility of nodes is high, so a traditional approach of routing is not useful.
This algorithm shows an hybrid approach, having both reactive and proactive components.
